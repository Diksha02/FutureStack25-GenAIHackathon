## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**89% of people struggle with daily planning** — wasting 2.5 hours daily on poor time management. We think in natural language but need structured schedules to actually execute our plans.

**Example**: You write _"gym at 7, deep work 9-11, standup at 11:15, groceries after 6"_ but end up with:

- ❌ No time buffers between tasks
- ❌ Missing lunch break
- ❌ Back-to-back meetings
- ❌ No priority awareness

## ⚡ Our Solution: TaskPilot

TaskPilot bridges **human thinking** and **machine execution** through a revolutionary two-pass AI architecture:

### 🧠 **Pass 1: Schedule Generation**

- Write your day in plain English
- Cerebras-hosted Llama models convert it to structured schedules
- Precise time ranges, durations, priorities, and buffers
- **Lightning-fast response time** (300ms)

### 🎯 **Pass 2: Schedule-Aware Coaching**

- AI analyzes your **actual generated schedule** (not just your input)
- Identifies real issues: missing breaks, conflicts, energy mismatches
- Suggests specific improvements with exact times
- Color-coded coaching sections for easy scanning
